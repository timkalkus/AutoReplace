# AutoReplace
WIP - Minecraft/Spigot Plugin to auto-replace broken tools and emptied items

A simple plugin with the basic functionality to replace broken items or emptied item-stacks with similar ones. It even swaps enchanted tools shortly before breaking and searches in shulker-boxes for replacement.

Currently build for Spigot 1.16+.

TODOs:
* add permission functionality
* add commands for (de)activating functionality
